### Technical details
* Utilized vanilla JavaScript and jQuery throughout to both provide functionality as well as build DOM elements
* Utilized Bulma CSS Framework as well as custom CSS for styling
* Utilized modals in place of alerts to improve the UX

### Challenges
* As a team, we faced challenges in styling to create the rich but simple user-friendly experience. Google-fu and support/input from other developers was key in overcoming these issues! 
* Javascript was a challenge with implimenting the different DOM elements as well as interfacing with localstorage. We overcame this by constantly doing research as well as by collaborating together
